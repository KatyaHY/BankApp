# BankApp
A simple end-to-end web application. The application interacts both with the client and the DB.

The application includes a login screen where the user is requested to fill in his ID number and a 
password. After login into the system, the user is asked to fill his details and the company's 
details that is in his possession. The next screen is the bank account screen, which allows to fill 
several (not predefined) numbers of bank accounts.
The system will store the data inserted by the user in the DB.
